# Trading Wrapped (Hyperliquid Edition) 🎁

**"Wrapped like format for your on-chain trading decisions."**

### The Problem
Trading is often reactive and emotional. In the heat of the markets, it's difficult to step back and objectively analyze your performance over the long term. Traders rarely perform the retrospection needed to identify behavioral leaks, "cursed" assets, or missed opportunities, leading to the same mistakes year after year.

### The Solution
**Trading Wrapped** turns raw data into actionable hindsight. By analyzing your entire year's on-chain history, it helps you understand your true performance against the market (and yourself). It’s a tool for honest reflection—packaged in an engaging story that helps you make better decisions for 2026.

### Key Features
- **The Roast:** An analytical engine that assigns you a "Personality" (e.g., *The Exit Liquidity*, *God Gamer*) based on your win rate and "degen score."
- **Deep Insights:** Visualizes P&L over time, fees paid, and best/worst trade timestamps using rich charts.
- **The "What If" Engine:** Compares your active trading performance against passive strategies (HODLing BTC, S&P 500, or a Savings Account).
- **Viral Sharing:** Generates a custom, high-fidelity 9:16 story card for instant sharing on Twitter, TikTok, and Instagram.

### The Stack
Built with a focus on speed, aesthetics, and interactivity.
- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Neo-Brutalist Design System)
- **Data:** Hyperliquid API + CoinGecko (Historical Prices)
- **Visualization:** Recharts + Framer Motion
- **Virality:** html-to-image for canvas generation

### How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`
4. Enter any Hyperliquid wallet address (e.g., `0x...`) and watch the magic.
